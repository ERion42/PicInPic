# Picture in Picture


## Description

This app puts one window inside another, allowing the user to view multiple sources at once. If you need to keep an eye on another window, such as an idle game, you can throw it up in a smaller window inside your main window so you can keep track of your DPS or cookies or whatever else while you're working. 

It could potentially be used to follow along with YouTube tutorials (especially on a laptop, if you're travelling and don't have access to your usual multi-monitor setup), but the resolution of the second screen might need to be increased for that. Especially if you need to read anything.

## About 

This is a project that I did as part of the following course: https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/. If you are interested I highly recommend checking it out, as it has proven to be very insightful and easy to follow so far.

## Installation

No installation is needed for this. The app itself can be run directly from the URL, and if you want to fiddle with the code you can just clone it to your local drive.

## Usage

Fair use.
